<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Welcome to our friendly Fishing club based in Long Eaton (East Midlands).&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>We are a small club with 20 anglers, that all get together every Sunday for a great day out.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The club has been running for approximately 50 years were it was originally the Granville club. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Formed by Jonny Spray and friends in the late 80's. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>We moved to the Zingari club were it continued to be a great success, being run by Peter Byewater and Ross Chanadella, and then Carl Fretwell</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>In 2008 the name was changed to the Curzon club. It is now being run by Craig Charlton, Richard Cowans, Steven Charlton and a great bunch of lads.</strong></p>
